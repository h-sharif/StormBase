\title{Extract Baseflow Component from Streamflow Time Series}
\usage{
baseflow_extractor(water_input, flow, is_daily = TRUE, Rmin = 0.02, Lmax = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{water_input}{Numeric vector. Time series of water input (e.g., precipitation),
in daily or hourly resolution. Must not contain \code{NA}.}

\item{flow}{Numeric vector. Time series of total streamflow or catchment response,
in the same temporal resolution and units as \code{water_input}.}

\item{is_daily}{Logical. Whether the input data is in daily time scale (\code{TRUE}) or hourly (\code{FALSE}).
Default is \code{TRUE}. Internally adjusts both series to an hourly resolution.}

\item{Rmin}{Numeric. Minimum rainfall intensity (in hourly units) used to delimit storm events. Default is \code{0.02}.}

\item{Lmax}{Integer. Maximum window length (in time steps) to explore catchment response time. Default is \code{100}.
Should be chosen based on temporal resolution (e.g., 100 hours or 100 days).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector representing the estimated baseflow component, in the same
        units and time scale as the input \code{flow} vector.
}
\description{
Identifies stormflow events and estimates a baseflow signal from a total streamflow
time series using the DMCA method.
The function assumes total streamflow is provided and subtracts a computed baseflow curve
based on event timing derived from water input and flow time series.
}
\details{
This function computes the baseflow component by identifying the start and end of stormflow events,
estimating a separation line (baseflow) between events. It is based on the same DMCA logic
used in \code{\link{event_identifier}}, with post-processing to extract the underlying
baseflow signal.

The water_input and flow inputs are assumed to be in the same units and temporal resolution.
If data is daily, the function converts both to an hourly scale by dividing values by 24 to
match the DMCA's hourly processing, then scales the baseflow result back to daily.
