Title: Objectively Identify Water Input (Rainfall) - Runoff Events
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Hamed Sharif

Description: This R package is based on the work of Giani et al. (2020, 2022), who originally developed the algorithm in MATLAB. 
    To broaden accessibility and support wider adoption in flood and stormflow studies, the algorithm has been translated 
    and implemented in R.
    Event identification is performed using Detrending Moving-Average Cross-Correlation Analysis (DMCA). 
    Building on this method, Sharif & Ameli (2025) identified a distinct class of rain-dominated catchments that 
    exhibit linear time-invariant (LTI) system behavior in stormflow generation.
